## Summary of Results

By looking at average Airbnb prices in different neighborhoods of Boston, it is evident that location matters. To maximize revenue, a prime location may help command a higher nightly rate.

Factors such as the number of guests accommodated and the number of bedrooms, beds, and bathrooms all have a relatively strong relationship with price. Accommodation with a greater number of any of these parameters may be able to sell for higher prices.

Lastly, linear regression on this dataset had fairly poor results as measured by R-squared values. More work is necessary to see if additional data sets or different interpretations of the available data can improve regression results.
